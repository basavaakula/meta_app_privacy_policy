I respect your privacy. This policy explains how I collect, use, and share information when operating the ABR News automated news summarization and video publishing service and related websites or apps.

What I collect:
- Public content: I may collect and process publicly available news articles, headlines, and public social media content for the purpose of summarization and redistribution.
- Generated content: Summaries, translated text, TTS audio, thumbnails, and videos created from public sources.
- Usage data: When you visit my website or interact with content, I may collect technical data (browser, IP address, device type) and analytics (page views, referrers) via cookies or analytics services.
- Contact data: If you contact me (support, opt-out requests, or inquiries), I retain the contact information you provide (name, email, message).

How I use information:
- Generate and publish multilingual news summaries and short-form videos.
- Deliver and improve the service, debug issues, and analyze usage.
- Respond to support inquiries and comply with legal obligations.

Sharing & disclosure:
- I publish generated content publicly on platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram. Public distribution is visible to platform users.
- I do not sell personal data. I may share data with service providers who help operate the service (hosting, analytics, cloud storage) under contract and only as necessary.
- I may disclose data if required by law or to protect rights.

Cookies & tracking:
- I may use cookies and third-party analytics (e.g., Google Analytics) on my website. You can control cookies in your browser settings.

Third-party services:
- I use third-party services (TTS, translation, thumbnail generation, hosting, social networks). Those services have their own privacy policies — review them before use.

Data retention & deletion:
- I retain contact and usage data as needed to provide the service and meet legal obligations. To request deletion of personal data (if any), email: basavaraju@example.com.

Security:
- I implement reasonable administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect information. No system is completely secure; absolute security cannot be guaranteed.

Children:
- The services are not intended for children under 13. I do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

Changes to this policy:
- I may update this policy. I will post the revised policy with a new “Last updated” date.
